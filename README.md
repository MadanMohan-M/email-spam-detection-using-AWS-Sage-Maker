# email-spam-detection-using-AWS-Sage-Maker
This project demonstrates how to build an NLP-based email spam classifier using traditional machine learning techniques and deploy it using Amazon SageMaker. The model uses TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, and it is deployed for real-time inference using a SageMaker endpoint.
